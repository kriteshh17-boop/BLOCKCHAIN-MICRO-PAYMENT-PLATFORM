# Micro-Payment Platform

## 📌 Project Description
The *Micro-Payment Platform* is a blockchain-based payment system that enables users to pay in small increments for digital services. 
Users deposit funds into their on-chain balance and are charged based on actual usage, such as API calls, data consumption, or content access.

This improves fairness, reduces upfront costs, and enables pay-as-you-go access.
